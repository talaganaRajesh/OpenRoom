# OpenRoom
Open Room is a real-time anonymous chat app where everyone joins a single shared spaceâ€”no sign-ups, no usernames, just instant conversation. Built with React and Firebase/WebSockets, it ensures fast and seamless messaging with a minimalist UI. Privacy-focused, it stores no data beyond the session. ğŸ’¬ğŸš€
